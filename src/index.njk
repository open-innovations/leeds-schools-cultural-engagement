<p>Cultural engagement enriches the lives of individuals, local communities and entire nations. Schools provide a common environment for ensuring provision of high-value cultural education for children and young people from across different backgrounds. However, there is a lack of data available to understand the cultural offering and engagement of schools, and how schools can seek support to build on their arts and cultural offering for young people.</p> 
<p>Collaborative activities within Leeds Cultural Education Partnership has highlighted a need for organisations to understand how schools in Leeds are engaging with arts and culture. In particular, there is a need to understand the current levels of cultural engagement in schools to inform Leeds City Councilâ€™s priority for Culture, particularly for the legacy planning of the LEEDS 2023 Year of Culture, and also the current Cultural Investment priorities for Children, Families and Young People.</p>
<p>To address this, a collaborative research project funded by <a href = "https://www.ukri.org/councils/research-england/">Research England</a>, is being led by the <a href = "https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/mechanical-engineering/staff/344/dr-briony-thomas">University of Leeds</a> working in partnership with <a href = "https://www.leeds.gov.uk/">Leeds City Council</a>, <a href = "https://leeds2023.co.uk/">LEEDS 2023</a>, <a href = "https://open-innovations.org/">Open Innovations</a>, and <a href = "https://www.theaudienceagency.org/">The Audience Agency</a>.</p>
