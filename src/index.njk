<p>Evaluating the <a href="https://leeds2023.co.uk/">LEEDS 2023 Year of Culture</a> has highlighted a need for organisations to understand how schools in Leeds are engaging with arts and culture. There is a lack of data available to understand the cultural offering and engagement of schools currently, and how schools can seek support to build on their arts and cultural offering for young people.</p> 
<p>To address this, a collaborative research project funded by <a href = "https://www.ukri.org/councils/research-england/">Research England</a>, will be delivered by the <a href = "https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/mechanical-engineering/staff/344/dr-briony-thomas">University of Leeds</a> working in partnership with <a href = "https://www.leeds.gov.uk/">Leeds City Council</a>, <a href = "https://leeds2023.co.uk/">LEEDS 2023</a>, <a href = "https://open-innovations.org/">Open Innovations</a>, and <a href = "https://www.theaudienceagency.org/">The Audience Agency</a>.</p>
