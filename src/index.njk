title: Leeds Schools' Cultural Engagement

{{ metas.description }}

<h2>Project aims and link to strategic priorities</h2>

<p>
Planning for LEEDS 2023 (L23) evaluation has highlighted a lack of data on schoolsâ€™ cultural engagement in
Leeds. There is a need for Leeds City Council (LCC) to understand the current levels of cultural engagement in
schools to inform cultural strategy and funding priorities. This project aims to support evidence-based policy
making through the creation of a prototype open data resource that maps cultural engagement in schools
across the city, enabling correlation with other open data sets, such as from the ONS. This collaborative
research will be delivered in partnership with LCC, L23, and Open Innovations (OI). The activities align with
the Leeds City Council priority of Culture, specifically L23 legacy and the current Cultural Investment
priorities for Children Families and Young People.
