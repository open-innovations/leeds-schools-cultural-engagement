<p>Cultural engagement enriches the lives of individuals, local communities and entire nations. Schools provide a common environment for ensuring provision of high-value cultural education for children and young people from across different backgrounds.</p>
 
<p>Nationally, cultural engagement has declined within education. However, there is a lack of data available to understand the cultural offering and engagement of schools. This evidence is needed for learning providers, the cultural sector, and the creative industries to work together to support delivering an arts-rich education for every child.</p>

<p>Locally, this data is needed to inform Leeds City Council's priority for Culture, particularly for the legacy planning of the LEEDS 2023 Year of Culture, and the Cultural Investment priorities for Children, Families and Young People.</p>
