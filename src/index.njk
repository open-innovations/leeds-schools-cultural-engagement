<p>
	Cultural engagement enriches the lives of individuals, local communities and entire nations. Schools provide a common environment for ensuring provision 
	of high-value cultural education for children and young people from across different backgrounds. However, there is a lack of data available to understand 
	the cultural offering and engagement of schools. This evidence is needed for learning providers, the cultural sector, and the creative industries to work 
	together to support delivering an arts-rich education for every child.
</p> 
<p>
	Within the city of Leeds, there is a need to understand the current levels of cultural engagement in schools to inform Leeds City Councilâ€™s priority for 
	Culture, particularly for the legacy planning of the LEEDS 2023 Year of Culture, and also the current Cultural Investment priorities for Children, Families 
	and Young People.
