  LEEDS 2023 worked across all 33 wards of the city and engaged with a wide range of participants across Leeds. The programme was designed to be as representative and inclusive as possible. The data and visualisations displayed on this page are drawn from the LEEDS 2023 Data Microsite, reflecting the impact and legacy of the programme by highlighting the ways in which LEEDS 2023 engaged with children and young people in Leeds. By doing this, we aim to advocate for the value of this and other similar cultural programmes, demonstrating how young people have been enriched by the programme.
