<h2>About the data on this page</h2>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-innovations/leeds-schools-cultural-engagement/main/data/schools.csv">You can download and explore the raw data here</a>.</p>

<h2>Where next?</h2>

<p>The data presented on this page comes from a pilot project, delivered by the <a href="https://artformsleeds.co.uk/networks/leeds-cultural-education-partnership/about-lcep/">Leeds Cultural Education Partnership</a>, that aims to validate the approach to data collection and school engagement for a future phase of work. This page could be developed in future to visualise a richer dataset of schools in Leeds, broken down further by each school's characteristics and cultural engagement.</p>

<p>Improving the accuracy of this dataset will allow for schools, local authorities, and arts organisations to inform their strategy and funding priorities, as well as enabling collaboration with the cultural sector. We therefore encourage anyone with an interest in the sector to reach out and take part in the next phase of work by emailing <a href="mailto:hello@open-innovations.org">hello@open-innovations.org</a>.</p>
