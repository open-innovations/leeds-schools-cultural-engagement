<p>There is a lack of data currently available on the arts and cultural individuals and organisations currently engaging with schools in Leeds.</p>

<p>This page presents an overview of how these people and organisations are currently engaging with schools, an approximation of the type of engagement offered by each organisation and provides information for schools to reach out and initiate their own cultural engagement initiatives.</p>

<p>The data on this page is indicative only and has been collected through research and analysis of open data sources. If you see any problems with the data on this page, get in touch with us at hello@open-innovations.org.</p>

<p>Data were included in the analysis if the individual or organisations was either: funded by Leeds City Council; funded by Arts Council England, or were funded by neither organisation but were mentioned in the survey. <a href="https://open-innovations.github.io/leeds-schools-cultural-engagement/reports/survey/">Read more about the survey</a>.
