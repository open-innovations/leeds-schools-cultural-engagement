<p>As part of the Mapping Creative Education project, a survey was designed to understand how schools in Leeds are engaging with arts and culture. The survey has been shared with all schools across Leeds, and is now being delivered annually. The dashboards below visualise responses from each year of the survey. Over time, results of the survey will be analysed to understand how attitudes, facilities and delivery of creative education is changing over time, and where intervention might be needed.</p>
