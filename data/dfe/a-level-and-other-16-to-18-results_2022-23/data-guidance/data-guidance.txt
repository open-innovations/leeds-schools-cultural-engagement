Footnotes:

1. Figures for the total number of students may not match the sum of females and males, as not all institutions recorded the gender for every student.
2. A change to the trigger rules was introduced in 2020/21  such that students were no longer automatically reported after two years in 16-18 study. The introduction caused a fall in cohort size, particular within the vocational and technical cohorts. A full impact analysis can be found in the methodology document (https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/a-level-and-other-16-to-18-results).
